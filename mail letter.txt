Dear Janet,

I hope this email finds you well. I have analyzed the provided dataset and would like to share the key findings and actionable recommendations:

Key Findings:

High Churn Likelihood for Frequent Technical Issues:

Customers with six or more tech tickets have significantly higher chances of churn:

6 tickets: 81.94% churn probability.
7 tickets: 96.55% churn probability.
8+ tickets: 100% churn probability.

Customer Demographics and Payment Insights:

Senior Citizens have a higher churn rate and may require focused retention strategies.
Customers using "Electronic Check" as their payment method are more likely to churn.

Tech Support: Customers who lacked adequate tech support were more likely to churn.

Overall Churn Rate: The churn rate stands at 26.54%, which is concerning and warrants immediate attention.

Prioritize Technical Issue Resolution: Address issues for customers with six or more tickets to mitigate churn risk.
Enhance Customer Support for Senior Citizens: Tailor support strategies to cater to this segment.
Review Payment Options: Investigate the correlation between "Electronic Check" and churn, and promote alternative payment methods.
Strengthen Tech Support Availability: Ensure tech support is readily available and effective.
Customer Satisfaction Surveys: Conduct surveys to identify root causes of dissatisfaction.

Reducing the churn rate will not only improve customer retention but also significantly impact overall business performance.
